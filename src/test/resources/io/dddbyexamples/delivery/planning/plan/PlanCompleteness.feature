Feature: Plan Completeness Policy

  Before closing, plan should fulfill demands.
  Over planning to 1 full storage unit per transport is acceptable.
  In other case, confirmation for each product is needed:
  confirm customer acceptance: „deliver part next day” or „adjust demand”.

  Plan Completeness takes into account:
  - parts amount currently planed in deliveries,
  - current demands expressed in parts amount,
  - the remainder (not fulfilled demands for product from last plan).
